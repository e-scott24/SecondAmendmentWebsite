				<h2>Second Amendment & History</h2>
				<p style="font-style: oblique; font-size: 20px;"><q>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, 
				shall not be infringed</q> (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript">Archives.gov</a>).</p>
				
				<p>The Second Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights includes the first ten amendments to the US Constitution, and was ratified in December of 1791
				(<a class="a-source" href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript">Archives.gov</a>).</p>
				
				<p>According to the text, the Second Amendment guarantees "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms" and that it "shall not be infringed."</p>
				
				<p>The text also states that it is for "a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state." This has caused a lot of debate over whether
				the Second Amendment is limited only for a Militia, or if it includes the right for any individual to have a firearm. There are also different opinions and debates on if people
				can simply own firearms or if they can carry them as well.</p>
				
				<p>The origins of the Second Amendment are often traced back to the English Bill of Rights of 1689. The English BOR "declared that 'subjects, which are protestants, 
				may have arms for their defence suitable to their condition, and as allowed by law'" 
				(<a class="a-source" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt2-2/ALDE_00013262/">Congress.gov</a>).</p>
				
				<p>The Second Amendment was also likely influenced by the early states' declaration of rights. The Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights of 1776 states, 
				"That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, 
				they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power." The Massachusett's Declaration of Rights
				of 1780 states, "The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be 
				maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it.
				(<a class="a-source" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt2-2/ALDE_00013262/">Congress.gov</a>).</p>
				
				<p>James Madison's first initial draft of the Second Amendment read: "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated 
				militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person" 
				(<a class="a-source" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt2-2/ALDE_00013262/">Congress.gov</a>).</p>
				
				<p>A second draft of the Second Amendment was made in August of 1789, reading: "A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the People, being the best security of a 
				free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed, but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, shall be compelled to render military 
				service in person" (<a class="a-source" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt2-2/ALDE_00013262/">Congress.gov</a>).</p>
				
				<p>Lastly, the Second Amendment as we know it today was agreed upon in September 1789.</p>

					<h2>Recent Supreme Court Cases Regarding the Second Amendment</h2>
					
					<p>The Supreme Court, for over 200 years, remained largely silent regarding the Second Amendment. However, in recent years, "the Court has provided guidance on the 
					substance and scope of the constitutional provision" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11108" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a>).</p>
					
					<p>That roughly 200 year "quiet" period changed in 2008 with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Supreme Court Case District of Columbia v. Heller</span>.
					This case started a chain reaction of more cases being filed in protest of certain gun laws because people felt their right to have a firearm was being violated by states.</p>
					
					<p>The following list includes this recent "chain" of Supreme Court Cases regarding the Second Amendment:</p>
					<ul>
					
					<!-- (<a class="a-source" href="" target="_blank"></a>). -->
					
					<li>District of Columbia v. Heller - June 26, 2008</li>
						
						<ul>
						
						<li>This case involves Dick Anthony Heller, a D.C. police officer, who applied for a 1-year handgun license but was denied. Heller subsequently sued the District of Columbia
						(<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						<li>"Provisions of the District of Columbia Code made it illegal to carry an unregistered firearm and prohibited the registration of handguns." The code also "required 
						owners of lawfully registered firearms to keep them unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or other similar device unless the firearms were located in 
						a place of business or being used for legal recreational activities" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						<li>The Supreme Court held that the "Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess firearms for certain purposes, including at least self-defense in the home" 
						(<a class="a-source" href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11108" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a>).</li>
						
						</ul>
						
					<li>McDonald v. City of Chicago - June 28, 2010</li>
					
						<ul>
						
						<li>This case involves "several suits filed against Chicago and Oak Park in Illinois challenging their gun bans after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in 
						District of Columbia v. Heller (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2009/08-1521" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						<li>The "Supreme Court held that a District of Columbia handgun ban violated the Second Amendment" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2009/08-1521" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>) and that 
						"the right to bear arms is a 'fundamental' right" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11108" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a>).</li>
						
						<li>"The Court reasoned that the law in question was enacted under the authority of the federal government and, thus, the Second Amendment was applicable" 
						(<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2009/08-1521" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						</ul>
					
					<li>Caetano v. Massachusetts - March 21, 2016</li>
					
						<ul>
						
						<li>This case involves Jamie Caetano who brought a stun gun inside a Massachusetts state court, claiming she needed it for defense against her abusive ex-boyfiend 
						(<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/14-10078" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						<li>The Supreme Court "clarified that 'arms' within the meaning of the Second Amendment encompass modern arms, including stun guns, that did not exist at the time of 
						the founding" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11108" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a>) 
						and said a "stun gun is not eligible for Second Amendment protection" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/14-10078" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						</ul>
						
					<li>New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen - June 23, 2022</li>
					
						<ul>
						
						<li>This case involves the state of New York requiring someone "to show a special need for self-protection to receive an unrestricted license to carry a concealed 
						firearm outside the home" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-843" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						<li>New York rejected Robert Nash's and Brandon Koch's concealed-carry applications, saying they failed to show "proper cause."</li>
						
						<li>NYSRPA v. Bruen "resolved two of the questions left open following Heller and McDonald: does the right to bear arms extend beyond the home, 
						and how are courts to assess purported infringements of the right" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11108" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a>)?</li>
						
						<li>The Court struck down New York's proper-cause requirement because is violated the 14th Amendment by "preventing law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense 
						needs from exercising their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms in public for self-defense" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-843" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						<li>The Court held that "the protections of the Second Amendment extend beyond the home and announced the standard to be used in assessing Second Amendment challenges 
						to firearm laws: when the plain text of the Second Amendment covers the regulated conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects it; to justify a regulation of that 
						conduct, the government must demonstrate that a challenged law is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation"
						(<a class="a-source" href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11108" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a>).</li>
						
						</ul>
						
					<li>United States v. Rahimi - June 21, 2024</li>
					
						<ul>
						
						<li>This case involves Zackey Rahimi, who was "involved in a series of violent incidents in Arlington, Texas, including multiple shootings and a hit-and-run. 
						Rahimi was under a civil protective order for alleged assault against his ex-girlfriend, which explicitly prohibited him from possessing firearms. 
						Police searched his home and found a rifle and a pistol, leading to Rahimi’s indictment for violating federal law which makes it unlawful for someone under a 
						domestic violence restraining order to possess firearms" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-915" target="_blank">Oyez.org</a>).</li>
						
						<li>The Court decided that "sufficient historical support existed for the principle that '[w]hen an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, 
						the threatening individual may be disarmed'" (<a class="a-source" href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11108" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a>).</li>
						
						</ul>
